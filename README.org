* top-level-keybinds
Have which-key show you what single-key commands are available RIGHT NOW,
sorted (by default) from simplest to most chord-ful

** Installation 
Using doom emacs, add the following line to =DOOMDIR/packages.el=
#+begin_src elisp
(package! top-level-keybinds
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "hugonobrega/top-level-keybinds"))
#+end_src
then run =EMACSDIR/bin/doom sync=

** Usage
Just call =tlk/show= (bind it to a comfy key?).
Pro-tip: also give =which-key-show-next-page-cycle= and
=which-key-show-previous-page-cycle= comfortable keybinds to easily scroll
through multi-page results.

** Configuration
- The variable =tlk/uninteresting-commands= holds a list of command names
  that tlk/show will ignore; we currently also hard-code ignoring command
  starting with =evil-=, those involving the mouse, and keys of the form
  =<...>= (TODO: make this handle regexps and avoid hard-coding). Default
  is =("digit-argument" "negative-argument" "execute-extended-command")=.
- The variable =tlk/change-look= is a boolean indicating whether to use a
  special look for the =which-key= buffer (including embedding the key into
  the command name when possible; see image above). Default is =t=.
- The function =tlk/comparison-predicate= is used as PREDICATE for sorting
  the pairs of =(key . command-name)=, as in the documentation for the built-in
  function =sort=. You can provide your own or use one of the two provided:
  - #'tlk/compare-keys: sorts by the size of the key-chord first, then by the
    length of the key in characters, then alphabetically by the key itself
    (not case sensitive). This is the default.
  - #'tlk/compare-command-names: sorts alphabetically by command name, compared
    using =string<=.
